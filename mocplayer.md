# We Collect No Personal Information Using Our Applications

We do not collect, use, save, or have access to any of your personal data recorded in MOCPlayer for iOS.

Indivdual settings relating to the MOCPlayer apps are not personal and are stored only on your device.
You might also be asked to provide access to your local or any cloud storages in order to import any music
files from this type of media. The whole progress works under your control and within the iOS app 'Files'.
MOCPlayer just downloads the music file which you have picked from the iOS 'Files' app and MOCPlayer 
DO NOT directly access your storage.

In addition, if you add a music to the playlist in MOCPlayer for iOS, the playlist is saved in the app storage,
but we have no access to that data and it is not shared with anyone.
